# Robot Framework Practice Project – Appointment Website CURA Healthcare Service (katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com)

## Purpose

This project was created to practice and improve my skills using Robot Framework with SeleniumLibrary. 
The test automation focuses on a sample appointment booking website (not owned by me).

## Project Phases

1. **Locator Identification**  
   - Analyzed the website to find and capture useful locators.
   - Created reusable keywords for common actions.

2. **Test Case Design**  
   - Outlined realistic test scenarios for user interactions on the website.

3. **Test Script Development**  
   - Implemented test cases using Robot Framework.
   - Focused on writing readable and maintainable automation scripts.

## Notes

- This is a learning project and not intended for production use.
- The website under test is not owned by me and is only used for practice purposes.
- I’ll update this project whenever I have free time to continue.
